## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Excercise in creating a Model View Controler project using scaffolding

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Visual Studio 2017.
.Net Core
Get started with ASP.NET Core MVC and Visual Studio: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?tabs=aspnetcore2x

## Example
<!-- Show them what looks like and how to use the application.  -->
The home page is still a generic .Net Core splash screen with a carosel.  The Movie App option on the black bar on the upper left leads to the special functionality of this particular app.  There you will find a list of movies if they are already populated in the database.  You also have the option to add new titles, edit enteries, and delete them.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Scaffolded Model View Controller archetecture, using C#, .Net Core and Razor Pages.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Added functionality to add and delete some things. -->
04-06-2018 9:00pm - Project built out almost per the tutorial.  Ratings don't get seeded into the database, and there is no rating option in the edit form, though you can create a rating when you make a new title.  Need to add CSS and other persionalized details.
